This demo implements the basic mechanics of this type of game. To begin with, there are two classes of characters, the mage and the swordsman. Each starts the game with a few coins and with their health and mana depleted. Characters can move, jump, deal and take demage, attack or cast spells while moving, pick up loot and other objects or interact with the store. Enemies roam until they detect playing character that they then chase or attack. AI enemies are able to deal and take demage leaving loot once they are killed.

The project is intended to represent the basic mechanics of Tower Defense type games in a single game level. When the game begins, the player can set up the towers along the predetermined path. There are five types of towers with upgrades to choose from. The first is machine gun wich shoots bullets at a faster rate, rocket shooter deals splash demage, laser wich is slow but powerful and the last two towers slow enemies down and rise the value of enemies in a given area. Game ends if enough enemies reach the end of the path.
